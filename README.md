# Algerian Forest Fire Prediction Project

🔧 **Installation**

A good practice to start with a new project and use it is to make a virtual environment for the particular project. Here are the steps for making a virtual environment:

1. Install `virtualenv`:
pip install virtualenv



2. Create the virtual environment:
python -m virtualenv myenv



3. Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
  ```
  myenv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS and Linux:
  ```
  source myenv/bin/activate
  ```

4. Install the dependencies of the App:
pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 **Test the app**

1. **Clone the repository**:
git clone https://github.com/izam-mohammed/Algerian_Forest_Fire_prediction.git


2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
cd Algerian_Forest_Fire_prediction


3. **Run the app**:
python app.py


The development server will be up and running on port 5000 at the URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Now go to the UI Folder and open app.html on the browser. Drag an image of your favorite celebrity from the five and hit the classify button. Our app will predict the celebrity's name with his/her image. It will also show us the percentage match of our image with all the five celebrities.

Hope you like this project !!! 👍
